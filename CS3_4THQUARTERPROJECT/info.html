            <h2> Abstract</h2>
              <br><br>
                <b>Applications of regenerative medicine technology may offer novel therapies for patients with injuries, end-stage organ failure, or other clinical problems. Currently, patients suffering from diseased and injured organs can be treated with transplanted organs. However, there is a severe shortage of donor organs that is worsening yearly as the population ages and new cases of organ failure increase. Scientists in the field of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering are now applying the principles of cell transplantation, material science, and bioengineering to construct biological substitutes that will restore and maintain normal function in diseased and injured tissues. The stem cell field is also advancing rapidly, opening new avenues for this type of therapy. For example, therapeutic cloning and cellular reprogramming may one day provide a potentially limitless source of cells for tissue engineering applications. While stem cells are still in the research phase, some therapies arising from tissue engineering endeavors have already entered the clinical setting successfully, indicating the promise regenerative medicine holds for the future.</b>

            <h2> How Does Regnerative Engineering Work?</h2>
              <br><br>
                <b> Cells are the building blocks of tissue, and tissues are the basic unit of function in the body. Generally, groups of cells make and secrete their own support structures, called extra-cellular matrix. This matrix, or scaffold, does more than just support the cells; it also acts as a relay station for various signaling molecules. Thus, cells receive messages from many sources that become available from the local environment. Each signal can start a chain of responses that determine what happens to the cell. By understanding how individual cells respond to signals, interact with their environment, and organize into tissues and organisms, researchers have been able to manipulate these processes to mend damaged tissues or even create new ones.

                  The process often begins with building a scaffold from a wide set of possible sources, from proteins to plastics. Once scaffolds are created, cells with or without a “cocktail” of growth factors can be introduced. If the environment is right, a tissue develops.  In some cases, the cells, scaffolds, and growth factors are all mixed together at once, allowing the tissue to “self-assemble.”  
                  
                  Another method to create new tissue uses an existing scaffold. The cells of a donor organ are stripped and the remaining collagen scaffold is used to grow new tissue. This process has been used to bioengineer heart, liver, lung, and kidney tissue. This approach holds great promise for using scaffolding from human tissue discarded during surgery and combining it with a patient’s own cells to make customized organs that would not be rejected by the immune system.</b>

            <h2>What are NIH-funded researchers developing in the areas of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine?</h2>
              <br><br>
                <b>The NIH has been a major supporter of research in regenerative medicine, aiming to develop innovative approaches to repair, replace, or regenerate damaged tissues and organs. Here are some areas of focus:</b>
                <ol>
                  <li>Stem Cell Research: NIH-funded researchers have been investigating the potential of stem cells for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. This includes the study of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their differentiation into various cell types to replace damaged tissues.</li>
                  <li>Biomaterials and Scaffolds: Researchers have been developing and testing various biomaterials and scaffolds that can provide structural support and promote tissue regeneration. These materials can be synthetic or natural and serve as a framework for cells to grow and differentiate.</li>
                  <li>Organ and Tissue Transplantation: The NIH supports studies aimed at improving organ and tissue transplantation procedures, including strategies to prevent organ rejection and minimize the need for immunosuppressive drugs.</li>
                  <li>Bioengineering Approaches: Researchers funded by the NIH have been exploring bioengineering techniques to create functional tissues and organs. This involves combining cells, biomaterials, and biochemical signals to replicate the structure and function of native tissues.</li>
                  <li>Gene Therapy: The NIH has also been funding research on gene therapy approaches for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. This includes the use of gene editing tools like CRISPR-Cas9 to modify cells and enhance their regenerative potential.</li>
                  <li>Clinical Trials: The NIH supports clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new regenerative therapies. These trials involve testing experimental treatments in human subjects and monitoring their outcomes.</li>
